# FinanceApp

This is my first MVC (Model-View-Controller) web application, which serves as my introduction to both C# programming language and the .NET framework. The application is designed to help manage personal finances by tracking expenses.

## About the Project

This project represents my journey into C# and .NET development, implementing key concepts such as:

- ASP.NET Core MVC architecture
- Entity Framework Core for database management
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Razor views for the frontend
- Basic dependency injection
- Service layer pattern

## Features

- Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap
- Data persistence using Entity Framework Core

## Technologies Used

- C# programming language
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Entity Framework Core

## Learning Experience

This project has helped me understand:
- The MVC architectural pattern
- C# syntax and object-oriented programming concepts
- Database operations using Entity Framework Core
- Web application development using .NET
- Version control with Git and GitHub

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure you have .NET SDK installed
3. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json`
4. Run the following commands:
